This plugin shows the bandwidth usage.

This is a wildcard plugin, the symbolic link should be named as follows:

vnstat_interface_period_what

* interface is the network interface, which should be known in vnstat
  (e.g. eth0).
* period is either hourly, daily, weekly or monthly
* what
  - rx    Received
  - tx    Transmitted
  - rxtx  Show both rx and tx separately
  - total Sum rx and tx and show as one graph

Example:

  vnstat_eth0_daily_rxtx

shows the daily bandwidth usage (in MB) on eth0, with separate graphs for
rx and tx.

Optionally, you can set the estimates flag in the plugin configuration file,
for example:

[vnstat_eth0_monthly_tx]
  env.estimate 1

This will show the estimate for the total bandwidth usage for the given time
period, similar to the last row in the vnstat output. Note that the estimates
for a single day are not really accurate, generally it's more useful to enable
this for the monthly bandwidth.
